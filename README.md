# SMART TRAFFIC LIGHT SYSTEM

As cities grow, efficient traffic management becomes a crucial factor in ensuring smooth commutes. I recently built a Smart Traffic Light System using Arduino Uno, and I'm excited to share how it works! üéâ

This DIY project features:

Automated traffic light switching: The system can change lights based on pre-programmed timing or sensor input.

Pedestrian crossing mode: Ensures safety by giving priority to pedestrians.

Energy-efficient design: Utilizing simple components like LEDs and Arduino reduces energy consumption while optimizing traffic flow.

Customizable: With Arduino‚Äôs flexibility, the system can be modified for smart city applications, including integrating sensors or connecting to IoT.


üìç Why is it important? Traffic congestion is a growing issue in urban areas. Systems like this can help reduce wait times, improve traffic flow, and contribute to safer streets.

This project has been an exciting step into the world of smart cities and IoT development. Can‚Äôt wait to explore more such solutions!
